# Random XKCD Comic

<img className="be-smaller" src="./src/images/RandomXKCD.png">

This page randomizes and displays an XKCD comic. This project allowed for individualized progress to meet the following objectives:

<ul>
  <li> Using React Hooks </li>
  <li> Thorough review of API documentation </li>
  <li> Making a number of different API calls </li>
  <li> Creating and designing features for a web app </li>
</ul>

I had a good time designing and implementing this creation. I hope you enjoy it.
